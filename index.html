      <p class="mb-4">

        This grid visualizes NBA teams based on their offensive and defensive "activity" during the season. It helps to quickly see which teams are more active on each end of the court.

      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">

        <li><strong class="text-gold">Offensive Activity (X-axis):</strong> This measures a team's offensive movement, with higher scores reflecting more passing and player movement. Teams on the right feature more possessions with a lot of movement and passing</li>

        <li><strong class="text-gold">Defensive Activity (Y-axis):</strong> This measures a team's defensive aggressiveness, with higher scores indicating more aggressive tactics like pick-and-roll blitzes and a higher frequency of fouls. Teams at the top blitz/show and foul more.</li>

        <li><strong class="text-gold">Team Name Size:</strong> The size of each team's name is scaled to its number of playoff wins.</li>

      </ul>

      </p>

      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">

        With an offensive activity score of 41 and a defensive activity score of 24, we are positioned in the bottom-left quadrant. This suggests that we are a team that prefers a more reserved, low-activity style on both sides of the ball.

        Successful Playoff Teams in 2025

      </p>

      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">

        Other than the main exception, Indiana, the more successful playoff teams tended to be less active on offense, with varying levels of defensive aggressiveness.
